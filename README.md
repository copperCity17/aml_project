# aml_project

This project is about food image classification and our goal is to design and implement a feasible and creative architecture. First, we experiemted with developing a CNN and trained from scratch. However, as the model performance was stuck at 35%, we decided to leverage other pretrained models for transfer learning, including VGG16, Xception, InceptionV16, and MobileNetV2. Image data augmentation was also applied to the learning. After training several epochs to achieve a certain accuracy rate, an ensemble method is used to average out the predictions.
